# BadUSB-UDL

This repository provides syntax highlighting support for Flipper Zero's **[BadUSB](https://docs.flipper.net/bad-usb)** scripts in Notepad++.  
It is compatible with BadUSB, Bad KB and USB Rubber Ducky 1.0

## BadUSB for Notepad++
UDL stands for User-defined Language. This resource enhances the coding experience for BadUSB script development using **[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)**.  
It offers syntax highlights for BadUSB and Bad KB scripts, supporting both light and dark modes, and all Notepad++ preset themes.  

BadUSB uses an extended DuckyScript 1.0 syntax which makes it compatible with classic USB Rubber Ducky 1.0 scripts but also provides some additional features, such as setting a custom ID check for the Flipper USB HID device that's injecting the script, Alt+Numpad inputs, the "Wait for button press" command, and Magic SysRq key inputs for Linux systems.  

### Highlights specific elements including:
▪ Delays
