### **BadUSB for Notepad++**
UDL stands for User-defined Language. This resource enhances the coding experience for BadUSB script development using **[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)**. It offers syntax highlights for BadUSB and Bad KB scripts, supporting both light and dark modes, and all of the preset themes in Notepad++.
